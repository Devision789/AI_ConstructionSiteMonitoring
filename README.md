# AI Construction Site Monitoring

Hello and welcome to our repository for the AI Construction Site Monitoring project! This project employs advanced AI techniques to assure safety and efficiency in managing construction sites.

## Overview

Our system is tailored specifically for construction sites to detect anomalies, assess risks, optimize operations, and ensure the safety of workers. It runs 24/7 and provides real-time alerts if it detects any safety breaches or anomalies.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring: Our system uses AI to monitor your construction site constantly and provide real-time updates.
- Anomaly detection: Using machine learning algorithms, the system learns to detect unusual patterns that may pose safety risks.
- Operational optimization: Our system can analyze the regular patterns at your construction sites and suggest operational improvements.
- Safety enforcement: The system can detect any breaches in safety regulations and immediately reports to the management.
